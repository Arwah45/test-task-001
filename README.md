# Simple Hello World Web Page

## Summary

This project is a fundamental "Hello World" example demonstrating a basic web page structure. It integrates HTML for content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, serving as an excellent starting point for web development beginners.

## Setup

No complex setup or dependencies are required. To get started, simply clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world-project.git
cd hello-world-project


Alternatively, you can download the project files as a `.zip` archive and extract them.

## Usage

To view the web page, open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge). You can do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer or using the "Open File" option in your browser's menu.

## Code Explanation

The project is composed of three core files that work together to create the web page experience.

### `index.html`

This file provides the structure and content for the web page.

-   It defines the standard HTML5 document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
-   The `<head>` section contains metadata, the page title (`<title>`), and a link to the external stylesheet (`style.css`).
-   The `<body>` contains the visible content: an `<h1>` heading and a `<button>` element.
-   A `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` loads the external JavaScript file (`script.js`), ensuring the HTML content is parsed before the script is executed.

### `style.css`

This file controls the visual presentation and layout of the HTML elements.

-   **Body Styling**: It centers the content on the page both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox. It also sets a background color and a default font for the entire page.
-   **Element Styling**: It applies specific styles to the `<h1>` (e.g., color) and the `<button>` (e.g., padding, border, background color) to create a clean and user-friendly appearance.
-   **Hover Effect**: A simple `:hover` pseudo-class is used to provide visual feedback when a user's cursor is over the button.

### `script.js`

This file adds interactivity to the page.

-   **DOM Content Loaded**: It uses an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded` to ensure that the script only runs after the entire HTML document has been loaded and parsed.
-   **Element Selection**: It gets references to the `<h1>` and `<button>` elements from the DOM using their IDs.
-   **Event Listener**: It attaches a `click` event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, the function inside the listener is executed, which changes the text content of the `<h1>` element.
